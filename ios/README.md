# Carvis iOS app (Meta glasses + George)

`ios/Carvis` is the iPhone app. The phone is the dashboard; the Meta glasses provide live
video. The **Ask Carvis** screen takes a photo with the glasses camera, sends it to George's
`POST /vision-query` with the question and the explicit vehicle (2022 / subaru / wrx), and
shows and speaks the manual-grounded answer or refusal.

The glasses code follows Meta's official CameraAccess sample and the Wearables Device Access
Toolkit (`MWDATCore`, `MWDATCamera`) 1.0.1 interfaces. No SDK calls are invented.

### Two fixes needed with a free Apple team

1. **Remove the Wi-Fi entitlements.** CameraAccess ships with
   `com.apple.developer.networking.HotspotConfiguration` and `...wifi-info`. Personal teams
   can't sign those ("Personal development teams ... do not support the Access Wi-Fi
   Information and Hotspot capabilities"). Meta's BirdSpotter sample captures photos and
   streams without them.
2. **Declare Bluetooth Classic.** Without the entitlements, CameraAccess's preview failed with
   `Device is not connected: <id>`. Meta's guide says camera streaming uses Bluetooth Classic,
   which needs the `external-accessory` background mode and
   `UISupportedExternalAccessoryProtocols = [com.meta.ar.wearable]`. CameraAccess doesn't
   declare them (BirdSpotter does). After adding both, preview streamed.

Carvis's `Carvis-Info.plist` and `Carvis.entitlements` already include both fixes.

Free-team limits: the build expires after 7 days (reinstall from Xcode before judging), and a
phone can hold only 3 free-team apps at once.

## Run it

1. Open `ios/Carvis/Carvis.xcodeproj` in Xcode. Swift Package Manager fetches
   `meta-wearables-dat-ios`.
2. Select the Carvis target, choose your team, and keep or change the bundle ID.
3. In `Carvis-Info.plist`, set `GeorgeBaseURL` to the backend. It defaults to a Mac on the same
   Wi-Fi (`http://<mac-name>.local:8000`); for that, run George with
   `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` from `backend/`. Use the HTTPS Render URL once
   deployed.
4. Run on the iPhone. On the dashboard, tap **Connect glasses** and approve in the Meta AI app
   (`carvis://` brings you back). Then **Ask about a part**, type a question, and tap
   **Snap and ask**.

## Dashboard and "Hey Carvis"

- **Dashboard:** the car hero, an oil change countdown, odometer, next-due item, maintenance list,
  and your own specs. Everything is edited on the phone and saved locally (`car-profile.json`).
  The pre-filled intervals and mileage are demo placeholders; set them from the owner's manual.
- **Hey Carvis:** a switch on the Ask Carvis screen. Apple speech recognition (on-device when
  supported) listens through the glasses' Bluetooth HFP mic, set up like CameraAccess's
  `AudioInputHandler`. "Hey Carvis, <question>" fills the question, takes the photo, asks
  `/vision-query`, and speaks the answer. Listening pauses while Carvis talks. Meta's toolkit
  doesn't allow custom wake words on the glasses ("Hey Meta" is system-owned), so this only
  works with Carvis open. Not yet verified on hardware.

## Safety rules the app keeps

- No API keys in the app; George holds them.
- Captured photos stay in memory and are never saved or committed.
- The vehicle is always sent explicitly; the photo never decides which car it is.
- The answer text is shown exactly as George returns it. Refusals ("not in the manual") and
  errors (`{error, component}` and `{detail}`) are shown verbatim, never replaced with a guess.
- The mock oil-change walkthrough contains no torque values, oil amounts, or intervals;
  the WRX oil section isn't loaded, so it points to the service manual instead.
- Spoken answers are labelled with where they played: the glasses' Bluetooth name, or the
  phone speaker as a labelled fallback. There's no separate DAT audio-output API; the glasses
  act as a Bluetooth audio device.
